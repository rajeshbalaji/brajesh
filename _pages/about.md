## 🚀 Professional Background

I currently work on large-scale enterprise platforms, focusing on:

- Cloud-Native Application Design (Microservices, Containers, Kubernetes)
- AI-Driven Observability & Reliability Engineering
- Zero Trust Security Architecture
- DevOps & CI/CD Automation
- Distributed Systems & API Platform Engineering
- Infrastructure as Code (Bicep, ARM, Terraform)

Previously, I contributed to high-impact initiatives at:

- **Microsoft** – Cloud & AI Platform Engineering  
- **Costco Wholesale** – Enterprise Platform Modernization  
- Global engineering engagements across Azure-based enterprise systems  

I have led cross-functional teams, modernized legacy systems into scalable cloud architectures, and implemented predictive monitoring frameworks to improve reliability, performance, and cost efficiency.
